## Self-Evaluation: 
how many points out of 10 do you deserve on this assignment: 

This assignment is extremely depricated and needs to be re-examined. I'm unable to complete most of the work as nothing seems to be working correctly. I'm not sure if I'm the only student having these problems but I suppose everyone deserves 10 points on this assignment as it cannot be completed with the current directions.

## Self-Reflection:

Again I don't believe this assignment can be completed with the current directions at this time.

### How long it took me to finish this?
 
 I was unable to finish or progress very far into this assignment.
